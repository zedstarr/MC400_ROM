Versions older than V2.60F live in here

**BEWARE**: versions pre-V2.00F use (ever-so-slightly) different executable file types and pre-date the SDK __AND__ need an older version of MCLINK.EXE to connect (MCLINK.EXE versions 2.8 & 3.1 that are in the wild will not connect!) so expect compatability issues.
