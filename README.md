# MC400_ROM
Psion MC400 ROM repository

Backing up and storing ROM files from the technical marvel that is the Psion MC400 laptop from 1989 - full multi-tasking GUI in 256k of ROM running in 256k of RAM on a 7.68MHz 80C86 running for 40+ hours on 8 x AA cells with clickable touchpad and with SSDs too!

Commerically unsuccessful so very few hardware examples are around

v2.60F was the "MC WORD" version, the last official OS release from Psion
